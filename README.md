This repo simply explains basic concepts of OOPs.
Abstraction: Defines what a class can do without showing how it does it. It hides complexity by providing a simple interface.Using abstract classes or interfaces to define the functionality without implementation.
Encapsulation: Protects the internal state of an object by providing controlled access through methods. It hides data and enforces controlled access.Using private variables and public methods (getters/setters) to control access to data.
