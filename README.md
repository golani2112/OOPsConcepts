Encapsulation
Definition: Encapsulation is the technique of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It protects the internal state of an object by allowing controlled access through public methods.
Purpose: It safeguards the internal workings of a class, ensuring that its state can only be modified through defined methods. This helps to maintain data integrity and prevents unintended interference from external sources.
How It's Achieved: Encapsulation is implemented by using private variables to hide the internal state and providing public getter and setter methods to access or modify that state in a controlled manner.
Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the concept of defining what a class can do without revealing how it does it. By hiding unnecessary complexity, it allows the user to interact with a simple interface.
Purpose: It simplifies complex systems by breaking them down into high-level interfaces that the user can work with, without needing to understand the underlying details.
How It's Achieved: In OOP, abstraction is implemented using abstract classes or interfaces. These define the methods that a class must implement, but the actual implementation details are hidden from the user.
